# Data Analysis Projects

This repository contains various data analysis and machine learning projects. The projects are developed using Python and Jupyter Notebook, covering essential data science steps such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, prediction, and analysis. I can not share the dataset because of the privacy of the bootcamp

## Diabetes Feature Engineering & Prediction

**File:** `Diabetes_Feature_Engineering/Diabetes_data_analysis_and_prediction.py`

In this project, feature engineering is applied to a diabetes dataset, and diabetes diagnosis is predicted using various machine learning models.

**Methods Used:**
- Missing and outlier value analysis
- Creating new variables (feature engineering)
- Prediction with logistic regression and other ML models

**Run:**
```bash
python Diabetes_Feature_Engineering/Diabetes_data_analysis_and_prediction.py
```

## Churn Analysis with Future Engineering

**File:** `Future_Engineering/Churn_analysis.ipynb`

In this project, customer churn analysis is performed. Feature engineering and various machine learning algorithms are used for churn prediction on the dataset.

**Methods Used:**
- Data visualization
- Feature engineering
- Classification algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression)
- Model evaluation

**Run:**
Open and run the notebook using Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook Future_Engineering/Churn_analysis.ipynb
```
