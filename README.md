## CRM / FLO CLTV Prediction

**File:** `CRM/FLO_CLTV_Prediction_miuul.py`

In this project, customer lifetime value (CLTV) prediction is performed on FLO e-commerce data. Customer segmentation and future revenue estimation are analyzed using BG/NBD and Gamma-Gamma models.

**Methods Used:**
- Data preprocessing and analysis
- Purchase prediction with BG/NBD model
- Revenue prediction with Gamma-Gamma model
- Customer segmentation

**Run:**
```bash
python CRM/FLO_CLTV_Prediction_miuul.py
```

## Diabetes Feature Engineering & Prediction

**File:** `Diabetes_Feature_Engineering/Diabetes_data_analysis_and_prediction.py`

In this project, feature engineering is applied to a diabetes dataset, and diabetes diagnosis is predicted using various machine learning models.

**Methods Used:**
- Missing and outlier value analysis
- Creating new variables (feature engineering)
- Prediction with logistic regression and other ML models

**Run:**
```bash
python Diabetes_Feature_Engineering/Diabetes_data_analysis_and_prediction.py
```

## Churn Analysis

**File:** `Future_Engineering/Churn_analysis.ipynb`

In this project, customer churn analysis is performed. Feature engineering and various machine learning algorithms are used for churn prediction on the dataset.

**Methods Used:**
- Data visualization
- Feature engineering
- Classification algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression)
- Model evaluation

**Run:**
Open and run the notebook using Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook Future_Engineering/Churn_analysis.ipynb
```

## Microbiome Analysis Project

**File:** `Microbiome_Analysis_Project/bootcamp_microbiome_analysis.ipynb`

In this project, microbiome composition is examined through data analysis and visualization steps using a microbiome dataset.

**Methods Used:**
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Visualization and statistical analyses
- Interpretation of results

**Run:**
Open and run the notebook using Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook Microbiome_Analysis_Project/bootcamp_microbiome_analysis.ipynb
```
