# Microbiome Analysis Project

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook, `microbiome_analysis.ipynb`, which demonstrates microbiome data analysis techniques. The notebook is designed as a practical guide for bootcamp participants, students, and researchers interested in learning key concepts and workflows in microbiome data science.

## File Structure

```
Microbiome_Analysis_Project/
│
└── microbiome_analysis.ipynb
```

## Contents

The notebook covers the following topics:

- **Introduction to Microbiome Data**  
  Brief background on microbiome studies and the importance of microbial community analysis.

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**  
  Steps to import microbiome datasets (e.g., OTU tables, metadata), handle missing data, and perform initial exploratory analysis.

- **Data Visualization**  
  Visualizations such as bar plots, heatmaps, and diversity plots to explore taxonomic compositions and sample clustering.

- **Diversity Analysis**  
  Calculation and interpretation of alpha diversity (within-sample diversity) and beta diversity (between-sample diversity) metrics.

- **Statistical Analysis**  
  Statistical tests to compare microbial communities across groups, including hypothesis testing and differential abundance analysis.

- **Machine Learning Applications**  
  Example workflows for classifying samples or predicting outcomes based on microbiome profiles.

- **Conclusion**  
  Summary of findings and possible next steps for further microbiome analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or newer
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages:  
  - numpy  
  - pandas  
  - matplotlib  
  - seaborn  
  - scikit-learn  
  - [Add any other libraries used in your notebook, e.g., QIIME2, scikit-bio, etc.]

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BeyzaCanakci/data_analysis.git
   cd data_analysis/Microbiome_Analysis_Project
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *If there is no requirements.txt file, manually install the necessary packages using pip.*

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook microbiome_analysis.ipynb
   ```

## Usage

Open the notebook in Jupyter and follow the sections step by step. Each code cell is accompanied by explanations and visualizations. Modify the code as needed to analyze your own microbiome datasets.
