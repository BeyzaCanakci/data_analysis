# Churn Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for analyzing customer churn. The main objective of this project is to understand the reasons behind customer churn and to develop predictive models to identify customers who are likely to leave. I can not sare the dataset because of privacy.

## Contents

- **Churn_analysis.ipynb**: The main notebook containing all the analysis, visualizations, and model building steps.

## Project Overview

Customer churn analysis is crucial for businesses aiming to retain their customers. In this notebook, various data analysis and machine learning techniques are used to:

- Explore and visualize the dataset
- Identify key factors that contribute to customer churn
- Build and evaluate predictive models

## Getting Started
