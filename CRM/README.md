## About the Project

FLO aims to develop a roadmap for its sales and marketing activities. To make medium- and long-term plans, the company needs to estimate the value that current customers will provide in the future by analyzing their past shopping behavior.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of information from OmniChannel customers who shopped at FLO in 2020â€“2021. Key fields include:

- master_id: Unique customer ID
- order_channel: Shopping channel (Android, iOS, Desktop, Mobile, Offline)
- first_order_date, last_order_date: Dates of the first and most recent purchase
- order_num_total_ever_online / offline: Total number of online/offline purchases
- customer_value_total_ever_online / offline: Total amount spent online/offline
- interested_in_categories_12: Categories shopped in over the past 12 months

## Models Used

- BG-NBD (Beta Geometric/Negative Binomial Distribution): Predicts customer purchase frequency.
- Gamma-Gamma: Predicts average transaction value.
- CLTV (Customer Lifetime Value): Calculates a 6-month customer lifetime value.

## Installation and Usage

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas lifetimes
   ```

2. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python CRM/FLO_CLTV_Prediction_miuul.py
   ```

3. Update the data file path in the script if necessary (default: `/Users/beyza/Desktop/miuul/FLOCLTVPrediction/flo_data_20k.csv`).

## Outputs

- Expected number of purchases for each customer in 3 and 6 months
- Expected average transaction value
- 6-month CLTV calculations
- Customer segmentation based on CLTV (A, B, C, D)
- Segment summary statistics
